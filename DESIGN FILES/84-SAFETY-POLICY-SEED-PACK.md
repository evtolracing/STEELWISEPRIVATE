### EHS-PRG-001: Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout) Program

---

## 2.1 Purpose & Scope

**Purpose:**
This program establishes requirements for controlling hazardous energy during servicing and maintenance activities to prevent unexpected energization, startup, or release of stored energy that could cause injury.

**Scope:**
This program applies to:
- All servicing and maintenance activities where unexpected energization or release of stored energy could cause injury
- All machines and equipment with hazardous energy sources
- All employees who service or maintain such equipment
- All contractors performing such work at Company facilities

This program does not apply to:
- Normal production operations where guards and other safety devices provide adequate protection
- Minor tool changes and adjustments during normal production that are routine, repetitive, and integral to the operation, provided alternative protection is used
- Work on cord-and-plug connected equipment where unplugging the cord controls all hazardous energy and the plug remains under the exclusive control of the employee

---

## 2.2 Definitions

**Affected Employee:** An employee whose job requires them to operate or use a machine or equipment on which servicing or maintenance is being performed under lockout or tagout, or whose job requires them to work in an area where such servicing or maintenance is being performed.

**Authorized Employee:** A person who locks out or tags out machines or equipment in order to perform servicing or maintenance on that machine or equipment. An Authorized Employee is also an Affected Employee.

**Capable of Being Locked Out:** An energy isolating device is capable of being locked out if it has a hasp or other means of attachment to which a lock can be affixed, or if it has a locking mechanism built into it.

**Energy Isolating Device:** A mechanical device that physically prevents the transmission or release of energy, including but not limited to: manually operated electrical circuit breakers, disconnect switches, line valves, blocks, and any similar device.

**Energy Source:** Any source of electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal, gravity, or other energy.

**Hazardous Energy:** Energy that could cause injury to personnel if unexpectedly released.

**Lockout:** The placement of a lockout device on an energy isolating device, ensuring that the energy isolating device and the equipment being controlled cannot be operated until the lockout device is removed.

**Lockout Device:** A device that uses a lock (key or combination) to hold an energy isolating device in a safe position.

**Tagout:** The placement of a tagout device on an energy isolating device to indicate that the energy isolating device and the equipment being controlled may not be operated until the tagout device is removed.

**Tagout Device:** A prominent warning device that can be securely fastened to an energy isolating device to indicate that the equipment may not be operated.

# SECTION 5 — INCIDENT & NEAR-MISS INVESTIGATION SOP
================================================================================

### EHS-SOP-001: Incident and Near-Miss Investigation Procedure

---

## 5.1 Purpose & Scope

**Purpose:**
This procedure establishes requirements for reporting and investigating incidents and near-misses to identify root causes and implement corrective actions that prevent recurrence.

**Scope:**
This procedure applies to:
- All work-related incidents resulting in injury or illness
- All incidents resulting in property or product damage
- All near-misses with potential for serious injury or significant damage
- All employees, contractors, and visitors at Company facilities

---

## 5.2 Definitions

**Incident:** An unplanned event that results in injury, illness, property damage, product damage, environmental release, or other loss.

**Near-Miss:** An unplanned event that did not result in injury, illness, or damage but had the potential to do so. Also called a "close call."

**Unsafe Condition:** A physical condition in the workplace that could lead to an incident. Examples: unguarded machinery, poor lighting, damaged equipment, chemical spills.

**Unsafe Act:** A behavior or action that deviates from accepted safe procedures and could lead to an incident. Examples: bypassing safety devices, failure to use PPE, operating equipment without training.

**Root Cause:** The fundamental reason an incident occurred; the cause which, if corrected, would prevent recurrence of similar incidents.

**Contributing Factor:** A condition or action that, while not the root cause, contributed to the incident or increased its severity.

**Corrective Action:** An action taken to eliminate the cause of a detected nonconformity or incident and to prevent recurrence.

**Preventive Action:** An action taken to eliminate the cause of a potential nonconformity or incident before it occurs.

---

## 5.3 Reporting Requirements

### 5.3.1 Immediate Notification

**All Employees shall:**
1. Report all incidents and near-misses to their supervisor immediately.
2. Never delay reporting, regardless of perceived severity.
3. If the supervisor is unavailable, report to the next level of management or EHS.

**Immediate notification is required for:**
- Any injury or illness requiring medical attention
- Any injury or illness involving loss of consciousness
- Any incident with potential for serious injury (even if no injury occurred)
- Any property damage
- Any environmental release
- Any near-miss with serious injury potential

### 5.3.2 Medical Response

1. Provide first aid as appropriate and within training.
2. Call emergency services (911) for serious injuries or medical emergencies.
3. Arrange transportation to medical facility if needed.
4. Do not move seriously injured persons unless necessary to prevent further injury.
5. Notify EHS and management immediately for serious injuries.

### 5.3.3 Scene Preservation

1. Secure the incident scene to prevent further injury.
2. Do not disturb the scene except as necessary to protect people or prevent further damage.
3. If equipment must be moved, photograph/document its position first.
4. Collect and preserve any evidence (broken parts, samples, video footage).
5. Identify and note names of witnesses.

---

## 5.4 Investigation Process

### 5.4.1 Initial Assessment

**Within 2 hours of notification:**

1. Supervisor shall visit the incident scene.
2. Verify scene is safe and secure.
3. Assess severity and potential severity.
4. Determine if incident requires EHS involvement or external notification.
5. Begin incident report documentation.

**Incidents requiring immediate EHS involvement:**
- Fatality or hospitalization
- Multiple injuries
- Serious near-misses
- Incidents involving contractors
- Potential regulatory reporting requirements

### 5.4.2 Fact Gathering

**Collect the following information:**

1. **Who:**
   - Who was involved?
   - Who witnessed the incident?
   - Who was supervising?
   - Who else was in the area?

2. **What:**
   - What happened?
   - What was the task being performed?
   - What equipment/materials were involved?
   - What injuries or damage resulted?
   - What conditions existed?

3. **When:**
   - Date and time of incident
   - Shift
   - Time into shift
   - Point in the task

4. **Where:**
   - Specific location
   - Environmental conditions
   - Equipment position

5. **How:**
   - How did the incident occur (sequence of events)?
   - How was the task normally performed?
   - How was it performed this time?

6. **Evidence Collection:**
   - Photographs of the scene, equipment, conditions
   - Witness statements (separate interviews)
   - Equipment condition
   - Relevant records (training, maintenance, procedures)
   - Video footage if available

### 5.4.3 Root Cause Analysis

**5 Whys Technique:**

Starting with the incident, ask "Why did this happen?" for each answer until reaching fundamental causes. Example:

1. Why did the employee cut their hand? → The saw blade contacted their hand.
2. Why did the blade contact their hand? → Their hand entered the blade path.
3. Why did their hand enter the blade path? → They were removing a stuck piece.
4. Why were they removing it while the machine was running? → They thought it would restart automatically.
5. Why didn't they lock out? → They weren't trained on LOTO for minor jams.

**Contributing Factors to Evaluate:**

- **Management Systems:** Policies, procedures, training, supervision, resources
- **Equipment/Environment:** Machine condition, guarding, workplace layout, lighting, noise
- **Human Factors:** Training, experience, fatigue, distraction, rushing
- **Task Factors:** Frequency, difficulty, hazard awareness, time pressure

### 5.4.4 Investigation Documentation

Complete the Incident Investigation Report including:
- Incident description and sequence of events
